		<!-- Main table for tasks 
                 Use model-view binding to render the rows fo this table
                 based on the models in the given collection. "dataCollection"
                 represents the collection used to populate this table. 
                 "dataFilter" is a function used to filter the list of 
                 models processed within the collection. "dataTransform"
                 is a function that will be executed on each model as it
                 is rendered as a row. It gives the opportunity to modify
                 the model's values before they are applied to each row.
